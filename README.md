COVID-19 Data

COVID-19 is something that has affected all of us, so we were interested in taking a deeper dive into the data.

Can we predict cases based on mask mandates/number of vaccinations in the USA?

H_0 = number of vaccines did not affect number of covid cases. 
H_A = number of vaccines did affect number of covid cases.

H_0_2 = mask mandate had no effect on transmission.
H_A_2 = mask mandate had an effect on transmission.

The COVID act now data API contains information about all states' vaccination numbers. Ratio of vaccines to the population as well as number of vaccines administered. 

## Communication Protocols
We will be communicating via slack, zoom, and texting.

## Machine Learning Model
(Y) Number of cases = (X) vaccines completed ratio to state population

## Database
Below is a sample of the data we are using:
