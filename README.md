# Covid Research Project

## Overview 
### Topic and Hypothesis 
There is plenty of argument in the US (and world) for and against mask mandate and vaccine mandate. Here we want to quantify if mask mandates, and COVID-19 vaccine are effective tools in fight against COVID-19. There are plenty of data available on mandates, vaccination rate, hospitalization, and covid related deaths. Here, our team will analyze following hypothesis. 
H01: Mask mandate does nothing to prevent COVID-19 transmission. 
HA1: Mask mandate does prevent COVID-19 transmission. 

H02.1: Vaccination does not prevent COVID-19 transmission.

HA2.2: Vaccination helps prevent COVID-19 transmission 

H02.2: Vaccination does not reduce hospitalization. 

HA2.2: Vaccination helps reduce hospitalization.

H02.3: Vaccination does not reduce death rates.

HA2.3: Vaccination does reduce death rates. 
 ### Data Sources 
The two sources we have picked are:


https://covidactnow.org/data-api

https://www.littler.com/publication-press/publication/facing-your-face-mask-duties-list-statewide-orders

The COVID act now data API contains information about all states' vaccination numbers. Ratio of vaccines to the population as well as number of vaccines administered. The team will create a database that would have information from above sources and run report sorted by states overall performance on different factors. 

We will be using data from March 01, 2021 to February 28, 2022 and analyze trend over a year. 

## Team and Roles 
There are four members in our team: 
##### Connor Cole: 
Conor is playing role of the square where he will be will be responsible for the repository.

##### Adibayo Ajibosin 
Adibayo is playing role of the triangle who will create mockup of machine learning model.
##### Hammad Rahman
Hammad is the circle of the team where he will be working with database and dataset  
##### Aayam Shrestha 
Aayam is the X and in charge of technologies decisions. 
### Communication Protocol 
We are using following communication methods 
Slack is for note taking and communicating to team members and also providing minutes to people who missed the Zoom meetings. 
Zoom: Zoom is to hold meetings and share screens for live collaboration. The meetings are not recorded however minutes are posted on slack.   
Github: Github is store work and so we can submit our work and combine branches. 
Phone and Text: If we need to communicate urgently and tell everyone something that cannot wait for them to be in front of a computer.   

## Machine Learning Model 
Our model is to show 
(Y) Number of cases = (X) vaccines completed ratio to state population

### Results are to be published.
